								<p>I was the Captain of my High school Robotics Team for 2 years. We created a robot that shot balls into a hoop and was able to hang on a bar using passive mechanics. We won the Georgia F.I.R.S.T Robotics regional competition for the first time in my school's history!  </p>
						        <h4> ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><p>Managed a team of 23 people and oversaw the progress of the electrical, programming, and marketing aspects of the robot which resulted in us increasing our funding by $3,000 and implementing advanced hardware and programming techniques. </p></li>
									<li><p>Led a Mechanical sub-team of 7 people to analyze mechanical systems, build, and operate a robot </p></li>
									<li><p>Won the 2022 Georgia F.I.R.S.T. Robotics regional competition for the first time in my school’s history! </p></li>
								</ul>
								<h4> A Short Story</h4>
								<p>  My senior year of High School, I was the Captain of my school's robotics team, and my role was to integrate my teammate’s skill sets and lead them throughout complex tasks. When our robot nearly collapsed on itself during one of our competitions, I did not panic, but instead focused on the task of building a completely new robot in two weeks. Though we encountered many obstacles, one being an immense time constraint, I remained encouraging. I believe that my attitude resulted in us buying into this “All In” mentality that allowed us to intensely focus on rebuilding an awesome robot in record time.  As a result of our focus, our robot did much better and placed 4th in our next competition. Later, some of my coaches and teammates thanked me for my contributions, my positive attitude, and how I included everyone in the development of the robot. I feel I was a good role model for women in STEM because this year there were twice as many girls who tried out for the robotics team.   </p>
								<p> Unfortunately, this was a while ago, and I've lost most of the pictures and videos of the robot, but please enjoy this building a robot in a week vlog!</p>
