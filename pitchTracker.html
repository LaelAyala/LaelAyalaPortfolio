									<h2><a href="stacker.html"> Designing a System that keeps track of a pitcher's tendencies </a></h2>
									<p> Designed a website using Javascript, HTML, and Python that tracks and stores pitches and their counts. This information is updated live in-game, but the user can also look at datasheets for previous games, so that the hitters know what the pitcher’s tendencies are.</p>
									<h4> A video explaining how to use the site</h4>
								</header>
								<div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-NBmvyClWHc?si=0a5c4pvbPW-yfbz6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
								<h3> Background information</h3>
								<p>  The purpose of this website is to track the pitch type the pitcher throws in certain counts to investigate if there is a pattern. This site will calculate and display the frequency of a pitch in a certain count as a percentage. For example, the pitcher throws a rise ball in a 1-0 count 70% of the time. If you are unfamiliar with the sport of baseball/softball a count is the number of balls-strikes, so a 1-0 count means that the pitcher has thrown 1 ball and 0 strikes to the batter. A ball is a pitch that the umpire deems the batter CAN’T HIT and a strike is a pitch that the umpire deems the batter CAN HIT. If the pitcher throws 4 balls, the batter WALKS to 1st base. If the pitcher throws 3 strikes before the batter hits the ball, the batter is OUT! Because of this, there are only 12 possible counts are 0-0,0-1,0-2, 1-0,1-1,1-2,1-0,1-1,1-2,2-0,2-1,2-2,3-0,3-1,3-2, None of this is particularly relevant to how to use the site but some people do not know how softball works and what a count is :). IMPORTANT: THIS SITE IS INTENDED FOR SOFTBALL PLAYERS ONLY AND INCLUDES ONLY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOFTBALL PITCHES IE DROP,CHANGE-UP,RISE,CURVE,SCREW. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BASEBALL PITCHES LIKE SLIDER, FOUR-SEAM FASTBALL, SINKER, ETC.</p>
								<p> In order to run the code, you are going to need to log into code.cs50.io. Type cd pitch_tracker in order to access the directory of the Pitch Tracker Code File. Then type flask run into the terminal. A url should pop up. Click on it to bring you to the site. Note: if it does not work type /login at the end of the url. You are probably not going to have access to this code since you are not in this CS class which is why I've included the youtube video and the repository </p>
